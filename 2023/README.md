# Advent of Code 2023

I feel that being comfortable writing (good) codes in Python and C++ as a robotics engineer is not enough to be competitive. So this year, I decided that I'd try to do a few things to keep my skills relevent. One of those things is learning new programming languages.

To be honest, programming is not my hobby. I don't do programming just for fun (well, maybe just not yet, who knows). So starting spending more time on programming outside of work is something non-trivial for me. I figure that if I decide to learn a new language by taking up some programming projects (which there are plenty of project ideas online), there is a very high chance that I cannot finish it. I need smaller subgoals to help myself get the feeling of accomplishments along the way. So solving programming puzzles semes like a good start for me.

There were a few candidates of relevant programming languages that I wanted to learn and I had no idea how I would choose just one first to start with. In the end, I asked ChatGPT to recommend me a number of languages/skills that I should learn then finally asked it to choose just one out of those candidates. It chose Rust. So here I am, trying to solve these puzzles in Rust, lol.

My Rust solutions here would very likely look terribly awful to the eyes of seasoned Rustaceans. But hey, I needed to start somewhere. I think it is very very likely that no one will ever look into this repository. But if that actually happens, suggestions are more than welcome.
